# SimpleCalculatorapp
I created this simple calculator mainly for personal use so I could have an easily accessible calculator.
I wanted a calculator that could handle simple calculations and that displayed in a seperate window so I could run it and 
whatever other application I was using at the time side by side so it would be more simple to perform calculations.
Run the code in VS code and the calculator will open as a seperate window
